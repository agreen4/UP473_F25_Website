To reiterate an important component of our [syllabus](../syllabus/index.qmd), the learning environment in this seminar depends upon your participation.

In an advanced seminar, the goal of evaluating participation is not to try to compel you to engage in one certain way, however, my expectation is that you will:

1.  Come to class prepared to engage with our course content.

2.  Be an active contributor to our discussion.

3.  Be an active conduit for resources and thoughts from outside of our course materials.

4.  Engage thoughtfully with course guests and speakers.

5.  Apply yourself in approaching our course conversations, assignments, and experiences.

Please let me know if you have any questions about these baseline expectations.
