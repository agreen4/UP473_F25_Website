## Description

This week, we will not meet as a class - instead you will work to finalize the theme of your policy memo.

## Prompt

Please refer to the [Policy Memo and Brief](../assignments/05_facilitation.qmd) to guide your reading this week. 

You should have recorded the topic of your policy brief on our sign-up sheet so you can be assigned a class session later in the semester to brief us. Use the [following link](https://uofi.box.com/s/dqye636xyx3kwm4k6s1o7ibdei3xtvtj) to sign up for a [policy brief](../assignments/05_facilitation.qmd) topic of your choice. You can use Box's *Excel Online* feature so that multiple people can edit at the same time.
