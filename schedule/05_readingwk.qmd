## Description

This week, we will not meet as a class - instead you will work in your discussion facilitation groups to shape your facilitation of the course module which you are assigned to work on.

## Prompt

Please refer to the [discussion facilitation assignment](../assignments/05_facilitation.qmd) to work through your module preparations this week.

Your group should also request a meeting with Professor Greenlee this week to discuss your plans.
