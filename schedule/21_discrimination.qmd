## Description

In our previous unit, we explored several elements of fair housing enforcement. This session will tie together those prior conversations with additional insights on housing market discrimination.

## Learning Goals

-   Understand more about how individual and structural biases within the housing system drive certain populations to experience higher rates of housing market discrimination.

- Understand how advocates work to develop evidence that will help to counteract discrimination when it is observed.
